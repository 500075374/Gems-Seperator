# AIM
Gem Sorting Machine 
(Based on Image Processing and powered by Artificial Intelligence)
# DESCRIPTION
Colour sorters are highly usable in big industries for separating items according to their colour and in filtering the things which do not fall within the acceptable criteria or which are desired by the user. Similarly, gem sorting machine is highly functional on a smaller scale. Using image recognition, the particular colour of multi-coloured gems can be detected with a great user interface.
# WORKING
The main software which is a Python application clicks a picture and crops it to the
specific size of a gem as per itâ€™s needs. The colour of the gem is extracted and is
converted into the RGB format. After sending the information to the neural network,
the exact colour is determined which is provided to the GUI. The main loop informs
the Arduino through serial communication, ultimately dropping the gem in the
assigned box according to the output of the software.
